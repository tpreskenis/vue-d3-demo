The follwing is a front end application demo of D3 built off of vue.  This demo houses two different D3 charts.  Each chart can then be further displayed over 3 different time frames.  The reason for this demo is to show how D3 can be used inside of Vue, as configuring D3 in vue can be challenging.

## Project setup
The first thing you want to do is pull this repo.  Then once you are in the root, run the following:
```
npm install
```

Once that is running then compile the application.
```
npm run serve
```
Data is also found in JSON files, feel free to change up data and change up dates.  The date is set for Today (April 19), but predictions will change if the date is changed!

## Roadmap

This demo is complete.  I will be implementing D3 into more items down the road, but for this demo, it is done.
